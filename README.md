# Enigma-Simulator
A simple Enigma Machine simulator created using the [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/) framework. You can change the configuration of the machine and the components used and it will encrpyt/decrypt your message as you type. It can be used [here](https://michaelbo1.github.io/Enigma-Simulator/).
## What I learned
